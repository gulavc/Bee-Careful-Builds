# Bee Careful

## The project
Bee Careful is a strategy game which represents a metaphor of the impact of human activity on bee colonies. Designed to be part of an education package, the game is meant to be played as an introduction to the very real situation of the extinction of honey bees. The playthrough would hopefully foster discussion and cause the players to go look for more information. 

In the game, the player incarnates a colony of bees that has built its hive near a city. They must explore their environment, gather resources and upgrade their hive in order to survive the coming winters. As the years go by, the influence of mankind is felt though the expansion of the city, blocking access to resources, and even destroying some of them, and the apparition of dangers, such as pesticides or displaced wasps, making resource collection increasingly more difficult.

Through this procedural rhetoric, the player will hopefully realize that without our impact on bees changing, they have very little hope of surviving in the long term.

## The context
Bee Careful was realized as part of a Specialized Graduate Degree in Game Design. The game was developed in about 3 months by a team of 3 students. Making a serious game was a self-imposed constraint by our team.
